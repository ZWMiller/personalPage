          <h3>Who's Driving the Twitter Discussion? - Social Network Analysis</h3>
          <small>Sep 4, 2018 - Python</small>
          <br><br>

            Twitter is a weird platform. Just, in general. The average Jill gets just as much volume as a world renowned
            expert. This is seen often in political discussions, and it becomes hard to tell who is driving conversations
            versus who is just reacting to the conversations that are happening. On top of this weirdness, there's also
            the inherent weirdness of the "retweet." It's essentially a way for someone to agree with a thought without
            having to explicitly do anything but click a button.<br><br>

            With that in mind, I started thinking about ways to programmatically extract who is generating most
            of the thoughts that are permeating discussion on a given topic. I landed on doing some graph/network
            analysis, very similar to a "social media network" analysis. However, I want to focus on "who retweeted
            whom" and whether there are any "big players" that lead the discussions that see a lot of retweeting.<br>

            <h4>Getting some retweets</h4>

            The main idea behind a network analysis is that we want to put every known quantity onto a piece of paper
            then draw lines that link up all the quantities that know about each other. Then we can do our analysis to
            determine connections between people, how important people are in the discussion groups, etc. So first
            we need to get our data and build a network.<br><br>

            To get the data, I built a twitter streamer (<a href="https://github.com/ZWMiller/network_analysis_tweets/blob/master/twitter_streamer.py">here</a>) that uses the pre-built Twitter API
            and loads every new tweet
            as it is posted. To help focus the analysis, I only kept tweets that had the words "trump" or "Trump" in
            them because like him or hate him, people are talking about him on Twitter. So we're going to be asking the
            question, "who is driving discussion about Trump on Twitter?" I then threw out all the "trumpy" tweets
            that weren't retweets, since I'm interested in finding who is driving the discussion
            via commonly retweeted items. Finally, I extracted just the user names and stored them in a file for later
            analysis. So when I was done, I had a file that looked like this:
            <div class="general_code">
            <pre><code><small>    original_tweeter_name1, retweeter_name1
    original_tweeter_name2, retweeter_name2
    original_tweeter_name1, retweeter_name3
    original_tweeter_name3, retweeter_name1
    ...</small></code></pre>
            </div>
            With this data, I was ready to build my network. Before that, let's take a quick look at what a network
            for this simple example data. Once we add a bunch of data, it will get quite complicated to
            understand fundamentally what is happening. Check out this diagram of an example network.<br><br>
            <img src="images/simple_network.png" class="pics">
            We can see that each original tweeter or retweeter gets their own location on the map as a <b>node</b>. We
            can then connect each node to all the other nodes it has interacted with via an <b>edge</b>, which are shown
            as lines in this diagram. The type of analysis we want to do is to figure out who among the users are acting
            like hubs of information for the twitter discussions. In this case, we can see that <i>OT_2</i> is sort of a hub,
            in the sense they put out an original thought that had a retweet. However, they aren't really driving the
            conversation as much as <i>OT_1</i>. That's because <i>OT_1</i> is more "central" to the graph in the sense
            that more edges and nodes center around it. In this case, <i>RT_1</i> and <i>RT_3</i> both "center" around
            <i>OT_1</i>. So we want to write code that can construct our graph, and find these most central nodes.
            <br><br>
            To do this, I used a python module called <code>networkx</code>. This allows us to add nodes and edges
            programmatically, building up a huge network of tweeters and retweeters. Then I asked the network to identify
            high centrality nodes via their degrees of connectivity. In the following plot, I've ID'd the top 20
            important nodes given a little over 5000 retweets collected in 10 minutes or so on September 1. The size of
            each node is drawn to correlate to how important that node is (larger = more important).
            <img src="images/example_network_hubs.png" class="picsWide"><br><br>
            In the plot's text box, you can see the user name for each of the important hubs of information (where
            importance means their opinion is being largely retweeted). I do not follow much political media, so when
            I first saw these names, I was quite confused about whether they were important. However, these people are
            all political journalists, actors, fact checking sites, politically motivated groups with large twitter
            followings, or Trump himself. This method has been able to identify people who often tweet about Trump,
            and also have a presence on Twitter capable of making their words carry out into the "masses." As an
            example, I had no idea who Daniel Dale was, but he is a journalist for the Toronto Star that covers the
            US President and has 380k followers. So his voice is on topic, and has a great scalability due to his
            large number of followers.<br><br>

            I've applied this tool to the topic "Trump", but if used in combination with the twitter streamer, it can
            be applied to any topic you wish. The streamer and analysis tools are available on my GitHub here:
            <a href="https://github.com/ZWMiller/network_analysis_tweets">Network Analysis Tool</a>. In particular,
            you'll need to use the
            <a href="https://github.com/ZWMiller/network_analysis_tweets/blob/master/twitter_streamer.py">Streamer</a> by
            modifying the last line of the code to stream around a topic you're interested in and the
            <a href="https://github.com/ZWMiller/network_analysis_tweets/blob/master/find_network_hubs.py">Hub Finder</a>
            to find the top users that are acting as information hubs.<br><br>

            I'll have a follow up post to this next week focusing on finding communities inside of a network, and how
            that can be used to find people that are sharing similar "discussions" on twitter - which will allow us to
            identify the "echo chamber" effect that many politics experts are decrying as a bad sign for democracy.<br><br>
