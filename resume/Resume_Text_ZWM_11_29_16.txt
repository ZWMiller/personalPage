Professional Experience
————————————————————————

Postdoctoral Researcher (2015 - Present)
University of Illinois at Chicago: Chicago, IL

 - Large scale data analysis to extract physics results from 100s of terabytes of data, focusing on electron channel results. - Member of embedding team that produces simulations for the entire collaboration. Responsible for production and quality assurance for the Heavy Flavor Working Group. - Co-supervisor of undergraduate research students (2016). - Member of maintenance team for Intermediate Silicon Tracker detector (decommissioned 2016)

Research Assistant (2010 - 2015)
University of Kentucky: Lexington, KY

 - Research and development for a prototype neutron detector for measuring neutrons produced by Uranium fission. - Designed and built front-end GUI and back-end analyzer for a data acquisition system to interface with and record data from detectors. Implemented the database that stores the data. - Measurements of neutron-induced fission cross-sections, filling in gaps in the world’s knowledge about the process.

Adjunct Faculty – Astronomy 130 (2011)
Eastern Kentucky University: Richmond, KY
 - Designed and taught Introductory Astronomy for non-Physics Majors.

Teaching Assistant (2007 - 2011)Eastern Kentucky University/University of Kentucky
 - Taught recitation and laboratory portions of introductory physics courses for both physics majors and non-majors.
