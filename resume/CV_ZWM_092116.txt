Research Experience
————————————————————

Postdoctoral Researcher (2015 - Present)
University of Illinois at Chicago: Chicago, IL

 - Member of the STAR Collaboration. Studied the formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Used heavy quarks as probes to study the properties of the QGP, focusing on leptonic decay channels of heavy flavor mesons. Also studied heavy flavor production in proton-proton and proton-gold collisions. 
 - Member of the embedding team that produces simulations of particles within the detectors to understand the detector responses. Produce embedding requests for the collaboration at large. 
 - Co-supervisor of undergraduate research students (2016). 
 - Member of maintenance team for Intermediate Silicon Tracker detector (decommissioned 2016). 

Research Assistant (2010 - 2015)
University of Kentucky: Lexington, KY

 - Researched and developed a prototype detector for detecting neutrons below 1 MeV. Used at Los Alamos National Laboratory to measure np-elastic cross-sections in a range of 500-1000 keV. 
 - Measured 238-U cross-section above 100 MeV. This work used np-elastic scattering as its standard, allowing for further constraint on cross-section calculations in the higher energy regions. 
 - Designed, constructed, and tested a second prototype detector made of multiple layers of one-meter-long plastic scintillator. This design was used to measure the low energy prompt neutron spectrum for 235-U fission (from 0.3 – 6 MeV). 
 - Developed new data acquisition system, both for waveform digitizers and for FERA based readout using CAMAC. Wrote the majority of the software (Java) and helped develop the hardware.
