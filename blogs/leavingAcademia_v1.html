          <h3>Why I'm Considering Life After Academia</h3>
          <small>November 16, 2016</small>
          <br><br>
          About a year-and-a-half ago, I moved into my first top-tier research position. I abandoned being a world-wide expert in a dying subject (I imagine there were only 25-30 people on earth who knew more about the process of neutron-induced nuclear fission than me), in order to reach for a loftier goal &mdash; become a world-wide expert in a cutting-edge field of physics research. I want to be clear at the top, this is not something I regret. In the last year, I've learned a ton about large scale software design, 'big data' analysis, shell scripting, cluster computing, the power of object-oriented programming, and the physics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). However, this has come at a cost, which is finding out just how insane the world of academia truly is.<br><br>
          My graduate research was fairly sheltered from the craziness of the academic life-style. My advisor had a long term grant and our research group consisted of him, two other students, and myself. It also consisted of a great deal of innovation. We were free from the 'publish-or-perish' paradigm, because our research was already funded for the next ten years. Practically, that translates into an ability to try new things because if you fail, you don't lose your career. And that is the feeling that's lost in academia now-a-days because at this point, grant money is more scarce than it has been in the past 75 years.<br><br>
          When I changed to this new position, I did not realize just how much politicking being an academic in cutting-edge research required; but I've been quickly introduced. I've seen shouting matches over 1% effects, I've seen cases where one person has purposely sabotaged another when asked for help, I've seen projects where one person who didn't do much work takes all the credit for everyone's work (and subsequently got hired in-front of the guy who did most of the work!). I read a post once where someone described academia as such: "Imagine you're in a room with 1000 of the most clever, driven, and cynical people you've ever met and a banquet is set out. Then the hosts turn to all in attendance and say, 'only the last person still alive may eat.' We're going to leave the room for the next 20 minutes, and whatever happens, happens. We only care about the results." That is academia. The key difference between the world of business and academia is in the phrase, "most clever, driven, and cynical people." I'm aware that the business world contains sharks, but academia is entirely sharks who have been put in an environment where only 1/1000 sharks has enough food to survive. Every single person is smart enough to ruin your career... and when grant money is so scarce that it's literally "my career or theirs," they do not hesitate to do so.<br><br>
          Since I've started discussing with my friends and family that I might be getting out of that environment, I've been met with a barrage of, "but you spent the last 15 years preparing to be a physicist, why would you change now!?" And to be fair, it's a good question that I've been asking myself quite a lot. With that in mind, I want to sort of layout in bullet form all the reasons I'm considering changing fields:
          <ul>
            <li> I love data analysis and I've come to realize I don't care if it's physics or not. I got into physics because it was the first time I'd ever been able to do data analysis and extract some form of answer from a series of numbers. I LOVE physics and the understanding it gives us, but for a career, what I love doing is the projects that physics enables me to do. I love sussing out trends in the data, converting particles into correlations, writing code that simulates particle collisions and decays, etc. It turns out there are whole other fields where large-scale data analysis is still a job description, and there are projects there that are just as interesting.</li>
            <li> I don't love arguing about 0.5% effects that don't change the conclusions of a study. I absolutely understand why academics do this as our goal is to unlock the truth. But I'd be lying if I said that this was something I treasured. I'm a conclusions guy. I want an answer to the why and how; I do not enjoy spending 6 months trying to track down tiny correction factors that do not change our undertanding of why and how.</li>
            <li> I don't want to spend the rest of my life wondering if the next time I apply for a grant will be the time my career dies. As the pie of grant money continues to shrink, it becomes more and more competitive to get a slice of the pie. Unfortunately, in most top-tier research positions, failing to secure a grant is a career-ender. For me, stability is a very high priority and as it turns out being an academic doesn't come with much in the way of stability for most folks.</li>
            <li> Competition/Politics. That's going to exist in every work-place but my experience so far has taught me that it's particularly egregious in academic circles.</li>
            <li>If you want to survive in the world of top-tier research, you must publish positive results at least once per year. Most likely you need to publish twice per year. For some developing fields that doesn't sound like a big problem, but for a field as well-studied as physics, expecting paradigm shifting results on a yearly basis is absurd. It takes decades just to BUILD an experiment in particle physics. The idea that my career could depend on 1) publishing as frequently as possible even if I don't have results worth publishing and 2) showing only positive results in a field where failure is more common than success is not something I want.</li>
            <li> I'm tired of working 10-14 hour days just to keep up. To be clear, it's not that I don't want to work hard. Quite the opposite actually. I've spent more than a decade now working 10-12 hour days between school and work, and I'm tired of working full-tilt for limited reward. I did a calculation, and if one includes the weekends that I work, the business trips where I work for 20 straight days, the fact that I work most nights <i>after work</i>, etc... I'm putting in an average of 10-14 hours daily. At my current pay scale, that translates to ~$13/hr for a set of skills that takes more than a decade to develop. Which segways to...
              <li> Money. I guess I may as well make this a full, honest disclosure and say I'm also consideing the monetary gain and my family's future. I've always heard it said, "do what you love even if it's for less money." However, it turns out that what I love pays on vastly different scales depending on career-track. If I stick around in academia, my career path tops out at $75k-90k. That is quite sufficient; but that's only if I get a full-time position at a top-tier research university or lab. Jobs like that are quite rare and the market is well-saturated. For every 3000 new physics PhD's, only a few hundred retire from full-time, tenure track positions. We can't all get those positions, and it's becoming increasingly common to string academics along with temporary position after temporary position... so they're alwas just on the verge of that aspiration-fulfilling dream job. In business and industry, it's not uncommon for folks with my skill set to make six-figures. Sure, 'money doesn't buy happiness', but up to a certain point they are quite positively correlated.</li>
          </ul>
          I won't lie, a lot of this makes me sound a bit like a whiner. Seeing it all typed out makes me wonder if I'm not being too picky and that whatever job I have is going to have some aspects of these complaints. Perhaps that's true. I'm at a fork in the road and I can either decide to stick with academia and ride that out and perhaps spent the next 30 years fighting tooth-and-nail for just enough grant money to keep my love of pure, only-for-knowledge research alive, or I can take advantage of the current trend in the business and industry world that is clamoring for more people that know statistics, data, and analysis (and rewards such skills!). Frankly, the latter is becoming more and more appealing, but the idealist (and the five year old me that wanted to be a scientist when I grow up) are still clinging onto a sliver of hope.<br><br>
