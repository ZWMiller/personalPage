          <h3>Why I'm Considering Life After Academia</h3>
          <small>November 16, 2016</small>
          <br><br>
          About a year-and-a-half ago, I moved into my first top-tier research position. I abandoned being a world-wide expert in a dying subject (I imagine there were only 25-30 people on earth who knew more about the process of neutron-induced nuclear fission than me), in order to reach for a loftier goal &mdash; become a world-wide expert in a cutting-edge field of physics research. I want to be clear at the top, this is not something I regret. In the last year, I've learned a ton about large scale software design, 'big data' analysis, shell scripting, cluster computing, the power of object-oriented programming, and the physics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). However, this has come at a cost, which is finding out just how insane the world of academia truly is.<br><br>
          My graduate research was fairly sheltered from the craziness of the academic lifestyle. My advisor had a long term grant and our research group consisted of him, two other students, and myself. It also consisted of a great deal of innovation. We were free from the 'publish-or-perish' paradigm, because our research was already funded for the next ten years. Practically, that translates into an ability to try new things because if you fail, you don't lose your career. And that is the feeling that's lost in academia now-a-days because at this point, grant money is more scarce than it has been in the past 75 years.<br><br>
          When I changed to this new position, I did not realize just how much politicking being an academic in cutting-edge research required; but I've been quickly introduced. I've seen shouting matches over 1% effects, I've seen cases where one person has purposely sabotaged another when asked for help, I've seen projects where one person who didn't do much work takes all the credit for everyone's work (and subsequently got hired in-front of the guy who did most of the work!). I read a post once where someone described academia as such: "Imagine you're in a room with 1000 of the most clever, driven, and cynical people you've ever met and a banquet is set out. Then the hosts turn to all in attendance and say, 'only the last person still alive may eat.' We're going to leave the room for the next 20 minutes, and whatever happens, happens. We only care about the results." That is academia. The key difference between the world of business and academia is in the phrase, "most clever, driven, and cynical people." I'm aware that the business world contains sharks, but academia is entirely sharks who have been put in an environment where only one out of one thousand sharks has enough food to survive. Every single person is smart enough to ruin your career... and when grant money is so scarce that it's literally "my career or theirs," they do not hesitate to do so.<br><br>
          Since I've started discussing with my friends and family that I might be getting out of that environment, I've been met with a barrage of, "but you spent the last 15 years preparing to be a physicist, why would you change now!?" And to be fair, it's a good question that I've been asking myself quite a lot. With that in mind, I want to sort of layout all the reasons I'm considering changing fields.<br>
          <h4>Projects</h4>
          I love data analysis and I've come to realize I don't care if it's physics or not. I got into physics because it was the first time I'd ever been able to do data analysis and extract some form of answer from a series of numbers. I love physics and the understanding it gives us, but for a career, what I love most is doing the projects that physics enables me to do. I love sussing out trends in the data, converting particle data into correlations and tracking down what the correlation means, writing code that simulates particle collisions and decays, and so many other topics that are part of understanding the physics, but not the physics itself. It turns out there are whole other fields where large-scale data analysis is also in the job description. In these fields the projects are just as interesting, or even more intersting, than what I'm working on now.<br>
          <h4>Culture</h4>
          There is the well-known idea of the "white tower" of academia. A stuffy room where folks smoking pipes and wearing courduroy sport coats have rousing debates about the fundamental truths of the universe. Each rebuttal is more wonderfully intelligent than the last. The rooms always smell of mahogony, scotch, a faint-but-magnificent hint of smoke, and the smell of raw intelligence that permeates the air. Unfortunately, almost none of this is true (I've seen many courdoroy sport coats...). The "white tower" is mostly filled with highly stressed folks working at unreasonable hours, defending the tiniest of details of their research against attacks from other scientists who need others to fail in order to advance their career. It's extremely rare to find a relaxed atmosphere where ideas can freely flow; between the stress and the paranoia that a collaborator might steal your ideas or sabotage you in order to advance their career, the atmosphere can be quite oppressive. If I'm being honest, I'm not floursihing in this type of environment. Instead, I feel constantly stifled by the need to have the results yesterday. I'm still actively questioning if my love of science is enough to justify remaining in this atmosphere.<br><br>
          I also don't think I want to spend the rest of my life wondering if the next time I apply for a grant will be the time my career dies. As the pie of grant money continues to shrink, it becomes more and more competitive to get a slice of the pie. Unfortunately, in most top-tier research positions, failing to secure a grant is a career-ender. For me, stability is a very high priority and as it turns out being an academic doesn't come with much stability. This leads to two trends within the culture that I find frustrating: egregious political maneuvering that takes up a vast amount of work time and an atmosphere of micromanagement. These are natural consequences of the low supply. When someone gets a grant, they must make sure that their work is visible to the donors and also that their employees are constantly producing at their maximum rate. This shows up most strongly in the "publish-or-perish" paradigm that has become a staple of academia. Most likely you need to publish twice per year, even if you don't have results that are ready to publish. The idea that my career could depend on publishing as frequently as possible is the type of stressor that suppresses my creativity in problem solving in favor of rushing to put out results without any innovation.<br><br>
          What this has taught me is that I work best when I have some autonomy and in an environment where the atmosphere is somewhat laid back. Constantly having someone looking over my shoulder to make sure I'm producing means that I often rush ahead into the job without considering what might be the best course of action. I always meet deadlines, even if self-imposed, but when someone else is constantly pushing forward, I feel uncomfortable taking a step backwards to evaluate the best way to tackle the problem. Most importantly, I've also realized that I don't need to be in physics to work on interesting problems. Any problem that involves data, code, and thinking critically is a puzzle I want to work on.<br>
          <h4>Overworking</h4>
          To be clear, it's not that I don't want to work hard. Quite the opposite actually. I've spent more than a decade now working 10-12 hour days between school and work. I did a calculation, and if one includes the weekends that I work, the business trips where I work for 10+ straight days, the fact that I work most nights <i>after work</i>, etc... I'm putting in an average of 10-14 hours daily. The idea of hard work is not bad on its own, but burn-out is a real problem. I've had folks argue, "but you're your own boss! Just give yourself a day off and regroup!" In theory, this is absolutely right, but the career-sustaining pie of grants is shrinking and the only thing between an academic and unemployment is being the fastest to get to a new result. There are always other groups of researchers working on exactly what you are, and if they get the result first, they will keep their jobs and you might not. It leads to a viscious cycle of, "I need a few days off to recharge my brain, but if I take them I might fall behind."<br><br> 
          For me, this manifests as a lack of innovation. I'm always working and producing results, but I'm never pushing the envelope of how we're getting the results. I could go through the rest of my career churning out result after result through shear "number of hours put in," but I also will be unlikely to advance the methods for producing results. I want to get back to solving deep questions with imaginitive and creative solutions. I want a culture that isn't working at such a break-neck speed that innovation isn't possible. That's why I'm aiming for my next job to have an atmosphere where stepping back to evaluate problems at the big-picture level is encouraged, and spending time working on the framework of the problem instead of the problem itself isn't seen as "wasted time."<br>
          <h4>Underpaid</h4>
          I guess I may as well make this a full, honest disclosure and say I'm also considering the monetary gain and my family's future. I've always heard it said, "do what you love even if it's for less money." However, it turns out that what I love pays on vastly different scales depending on career-track. If I stick around in academia, my career path tops out at $75k-90k. That is quite sufficient and nothing to thumb my nose at; but that's only available if I get a full-time position at a top-tier research university or lab. Jobs like that are quite rare and the market is well-saturated. For the ~1200 new physics PhD's granted each year, only a few hundred people retire from full-time, tenure track positions. We can't all get those positions, and it's becoming increasingly common to string academics along with temporary position after temporary position such that they're always just on the verge of that aspiration-fulfilling dream job. On the other hand, in industry, it's not uncommon for folks with my skill set to find positions with six-figures as the mean salary. Sure, 'money doesn't buy happiness', but up to a certain point they are quite positively correlated. Part of learning that I love the projects as much as the physics, is also understanding that finding a position that allows my family to be comfortable and stable, while still working on awesome projects is a valid desire. It does not mean that I'm giving up on science, as many in academia seem to believe.<br>
          <h4>Where do I go from here?</h4>
          With all this in mind, I'm still at a fork in the road. I can either decide to stick with academia and ride that out and perhaps spend the next 30 years fighting tooth-and-nail for just enough grant money to keep my love of pure, only-for-knowledge research alive; or I can take advantage of the current trend in the business and industry world that is clamoring for more people that know statistics, data, and analysis (and rewards such skills!). Frankly, the latter is becoming more and more appealing, but the idealist (and the five year old me that wanted to be a scientist when I grow up) are still clinging onto a sliver of hope that the dream-fulfilling super job in the white tower of academia is just around the corner.<br><br>
